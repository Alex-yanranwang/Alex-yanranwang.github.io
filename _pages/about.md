Yanran Wang is a Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where he is co-supervised by [Dr. David Boyle](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.boyle) and [Prof. Robert Shorten](https://robertshorten.com/). Currently, he is working in [Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (SysAL)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/systems-algorithms-design-lab/). Prior to joining Imperial College, he received an M.S. degree in Information and Control at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China, in 2020 and a B.S. degree in Automation at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, in 2017.

His research interests mainly include **Trustworthy Autonomous System Design** through **Formal Guarantees** on **Interpretable** reinforcement learning and optimal control theories. Particularly, he is interested in the theories and algorithms that empower aerial robots to see and think more intelligently. Beyond his academic pursuits, he has a passion for classical music and sports.

Please feel free to contact should you be interested in his research.
