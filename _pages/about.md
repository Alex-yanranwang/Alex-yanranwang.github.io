Yanran Wang is a Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where he is fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. David Boyle](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/david.boyle) and co-supervised by [Prof. Robert Shorten](https://robertshorten.com/). Prior to joining Imperial College, he received an M.S. degree in Information and Control at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China, in 2020, and a B.S. degree in Automation at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, China, in 2017.

His research interest lies in **Trustworthy Autonomous System Design**, with a focus on achieving **Interpretability** via **Formal Guarantees** in reinforcement learning and optimal control theories. Particularly, he is keen on applying these theories to intelligent aerial robots to practically verify the decision-interpretation. Please feel free to reach out should you be interested in his research.

Beyond his academic pursuits, he has a deep passion for classical music and sports.
